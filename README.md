## About This Project

This is a **self-initiated project**, developed in parallel with our university coursework.  
It is not part of any official assignment â€” we are building it for **learning purposes** and to improve our teamwork skills.  

### ðŸ‘¥ Team & Roles
- **Mahesh** â†’ Frontend development (React) and Backend development (FastAPI)  
- **Dilanka** â†’ Backend development and Database handling (PostgreSQL)  
- **Nipuna** â†’ UI/UX design (Figma prototypes and design workflows)  

Our shared goal is to gain hands-on experience with **React, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL** by building a full-stack application together.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
